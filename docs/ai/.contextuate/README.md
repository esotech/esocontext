# Contextuate Framework

> **DO NOT MODIFY FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY**
>
> This folder contains the core Contextuate framework files. These are managed by the installer and will be overwritten during updates.

---

## Quick Start

After installation, customize your project context in `docs/ai/context.md`. AI assistants will automatically read this file when they start.

---

## Available Tools

Contextuate includes AI tool guides - markdown files that AI assistants read and follow to perform tasks. Ask your AI assistant to use these tools with natural language.

### Standards Detector

Analyzes your codebase to detect and document coding standards.

**How to use:** Ask your AI assistant:
> "Detect the coding standards for this project"
> "Analyze my code and create coding standards"
> "Generate standards documentation from my source files"

**What it does:**
1. Scans for source files (PHP, JS, TS, etc.)
2. Checks for config files (.eslintrc, phpcs.xml, etc.)
3. Analyzes patterns (indentation, naming, braces)
4. Creates standards files in `docs/ai/standards/`

**Guide:** [tools/standards-detector.tool.md](tools/standards-detector.tool.md)

---

### Quickref Generator

Creates condensed, AI-friendly references from large documentation files.

**How to use:** Ask your AI assistant:
> "Generate a quickref for docs/classes/user-service.md"
> "Create a quick reference for the API documentation"
> "Make a condensed reference for this class"

**What it does:**
1. Reads source documentation
2. Extracts method/API signatures
3. Creates scannable reference tables
4. Outputs to `docs/ai/quickrefs/{name}.quickref.md`

**When to use:**
- Documentation exceeds ~200 lines
- Methods are frequently looked up
- AI needs method awareness without full context

**Guide:** [tools/quickref.tool.md](tools/quickref.tool.md)

---

### Agent Creator

Creates new AI agent definitions following Contextuate patterns.

**How to use:** Ask your AI assistant:
> "Create an agent for database operations"
> "Make a new agent for the authentication system"
> "Generate an agent definition for React components"

**What it does:**
1. Determines agent scope and responsibilities
2. Creates supporting docs if needed
3. Generates agent file from template
4. Outputs to `docs/ai/agents/{domain}-expert.agent.md`

**Guide:** [tools/agent-creator.tool.md](tools/agent-creator.tool.md)

## Standards Resolution

When AI looks up coding standards for a language:

1. **User Standards (First):** `docs/ai/standards/{language}.standards.md`
2. **Framework Standards (Fallback):** `docs/ai/.context/templates/standards/{language}.standards.md`
3. **General Principles (Always):** `docs/ai/.context/standards/coding-standards.md`

---

## Framework Scripts

### install.sh

```bash
# Remote installation
curl -fsSL https://contextuate.md/install.sh | bash

# With options
curl -fsSL https://contextuate.md/install.sh | bash -s -- --force
```

**Options:**
- `--force` - Overwrite existing files
- `--no-git` - Don't modify .gitignore

### update.sh

```bash
./docs/ai/.context/bin/update.sh
```

Updates framework files while preserving your customizations.

## Agents vs Tools

| Type | Purpose | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Agent** | Persona with expertise, decision-making | `agents/*.agent.md` |
| **Tool** | Step-by-step process guide | `tools/*.tool.md` |

**Agents** define *who* the AI is acting as (e.g., "documentation expert").
**Tools** define *how* to accomplish a specific task (e.g., "follow these steps to generate a quickref").
